# K6

This contains a few different types of tests.

- [load-test-graph](https://github.com/ericbutera/amalgam/blob/ad3d79839030889826a8fb2f0c0dcad48bf9d06e/k6/load-test-graph/script.js) - simulates moderate traffic to the graph service; this can be significantly ramped up to test the limits of the service.
- [simulate users](https://github.com/ericbutera/amalgam/blob/ad3d79839030889826a8fb2f0c0dcad48bf9d06e/k6/simulate-traffic/script.js) - this is a simple script that simulates users visiting the site.
- [tests](./tests/) - original OpenAPI generated tests for deprecated API.
