  # note: golang-checks have been moved to go-coverage and golangci-lint.yaml (much nicer)
  # i still prefer to have the ability to run these fast & locally. it's possible to run
  # these locally with act, but it is a bit slow. this should also be reflected in
  # pre-commit. it's very jarring when something behaves differently locally vs in CI.
