# graphql-schema

This will create a GraphQL schema from a running GraphQL server. It is a necessary prerequisite for generating GraphQL clients.

The command is intended to be ran from the project root using `just generate-graph-schema` [source](https://github.com/ericbutera/amalgam/blob/ad3d79839030889826a8fb2f0c0dcad48bf9d06e/justfile#L151-L156).
